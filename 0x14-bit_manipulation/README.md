0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
This project aims to provide an understanding of how to manipulate bits and utilize bitwise operators in the C programming language.

Requirements
Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs

All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All files ended with a new line

I included a README.md file at the root of the project folder, as required

My code adhered to the Betty style, which was validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

I avoided using global variables throughout the project

Each file contained no more than 5 functions

I only utilized the following C standard library functions: malloc, free, and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., were forbidden

I was allowed to use _putchar

I didn't include or push _putchar.c, as ALX used their own file for evaluation

The provided examples included main.c files for testing, but I didn't have to push them to my repository. ALX used their own main.c files, which may have differed from the provided examples

I included the prototypes of all my functions, as well as the _putchar function, in the header file named main.h

I ensured that all my header files were include guarded

File Descriptions
0-binary_to_uint.c: Converted a binary number to an unsigned integer.

1-print_binary.c: Printed the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c: Retrieved the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c: Set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4-clear_bit.c: Set the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5-flip_bits.c: Calculated the number of bits that needed to be flipped to transform one number into another.

100-get_endianness.c: Checked the endianness of the system.

101-password: Contained the password for the crackme3 executable.
